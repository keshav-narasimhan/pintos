                           ARGUMENT PASSING
                           ================

Did not use any data structures or global variables for arg passing purposes. However, 
we did change the method declaration of setup_stack() to be:
static bool setup_stack(void **esp, char *cmd_string, char **save_ptr) in order to utilize strtok_r() 
in both load() and setup_stack() simultaneously.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

In order to pass arguments, we first parse the command line string 
into an array of character pointers (char**) using strtok_r(). Then, 
as we are pushing these arguments onto the stack, we keep track of the
address of each of these arguments in a secondary 2D char array (char**).
After word-aligning, we can then push these addresses onto the stack
to complete the pushing of both argv[][] and argv[]. In terms of making 
sure that the args are in the right order, we copied both the argv[][]
and argv[] arguments in order as they appear in the original command 
string. Thus, for pushing onto the stack, we make sure to traverse the
two arrays backwards so that we are pushing the last argument first and
the first argument last (same with their respective addresses). Once
we have pushed argv[][] and argv[], we push the address of argv[0] as 
the 'argv' argument. Since we know the length of the array of command line
arguments, we then push that value as argc, and then simply push
the fake return address to complete the setup of the stack. In this project, 
the stack is a fixed size. Therefore, we don’t have to worry about growing it 
or decrementing it. Since it’s a fixed size (of a single page), overflowing 
the stack causes a page fault, which we handle in our exception code by exiting.

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

In strtok(), the function holds on to the last token which is used to 
calculate the next token to return. If there were multiple threads that 
called strtok(), then this could cause a race condition and end up crashing 
the system. strtok_r() is better for multiple threads, as well as sets delimiters to 
null pointers. Which is why instead of using string literals, we use 
an array of char pointers that can be modified.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Thread: We added semaphores to ensure proper synchronization for loading/exiting processes, and also kept track of child processes (list) and the thread's
parent (parent_tid). We also added a file descriptor table to allow threads to open/read/write/close files.

struct thread {
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t              tid;      /* Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;   /* Thread state. */
    char               name[16]; /* Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t           *stack;    /* Saved stack pointer. */
    int                priority; /* Priority. */
    struct list_elem   allelem;  /* List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem; /* List element. */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
    int exitStatus;                     /* exit status */
    // struct file *fdtab[25];
    struct list fdtab;                  /* file descriptor table */
    int next_fd;                        /* index of next fd */
    struct file *executable;            /* executable file */
    tid_t parent_tid;                   /* reference to this thread's parent */
    struct semaphore launched;          /* semaphore for launching */
    struct semaphore exit;              /* semaphore used to reap exit status of child in process_wait() */
    struct semaphore avoid_exit_errs;   /* semaphore used to allow parent to get the exit status of child in process_wait() */
#endif

    /* struct list child_processes;    // list of all child processes of this thread */

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    unsigned magic; /* Detects stack overflow. */
};

File Descriptor: We added a struct that functions as a file descriptor (holds fd and the file) to allow threads to keep a list of files in use (for
read/write/open/close syscalls).

struct file_descriptor {
    int fd;
    struct file *f;
    struct list_elem elem;
};

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?


We implemented file descriptors to be unique to each process. Each process
maintains a list of file_descriptors (see B1 for struct implementation), and we 
also use a variable in struct thread called 'next_fd' which is used to get
the next value that can be assigned to a new file when opened. We initialize this
value to 3 since we take STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR into account. This makes it
easy to add new files to the list, as we simply utilize the 'next_fd' to give 
the file descriptor's value and simply add it to the list. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

We first identify if the passed stack pointer is a valid pointer in the system. 
If the pointer turns out to be invalid, we exit the system. If it is valid, we
simply dereference the pointer and pop off the three arguments (fd, buffer, and 
size) needed for writing or reading. If these arguments were located in invalid
memory space, we also exit the program. If not, we simply call functions we
created to implemented the read and write syscalls. Within these functions, we do
additional checking to ensure the fd and size arguments passed are valid, and ensure
every pointer in buffer is valid as well. If all of these hold to be true, we then
can utilize built-in function to write and read user data.

The least number of calls is 1, and the most is 4096. If the data is continuous,
then it would take just 1 call. However, if every byte of data is split up into 
different pages, it would take a max of 4096 calls. By that same logic, for 2 bytes
of data, the minimum would be 1 call while the maximum number of calls would
be 2 (as the 2 bytes could be in separate pages). A better approach could be that
since we know that the page size is 4096 bytes, that the data must exist within 
2 pages, and thus it is not necessary to check every single byte, but yet to simply
check the first byte of each page that the data spans. 

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The wait system call pops off the child process id, and then calls 
our_sys_wait() with the child process id. our_sys_wait() in turn calls 
process_wait(). We first check to see if the thread we want to wait on
is valid or the current thread's child, and if either of these are not true,
we return an error (-1). If these both hold true, we then lock the child's
exit semaphore, which forces the current thread to wait until the child 
finishes in process_exit() and calls sema_up on its exit semaphore. Since
we want to ensure we can safely retrieve the child's exit status, we call
sema_up on the child's avoid_exit_errs semaphore in process_exit(), where 
the child is forced to wait for the current thread (parent), who will get 
its exit status and then sema_up on the child's avoid_exit_errs semaphore. We
then can return this exit status while the child can safely terminate.

Error handling is done at 2 different places, in order to "avoid
obscuring the primary function of the code in a morass of error handling".
We check for invalid pointers whenever the syscall requires it, and immediately
exit if the access is invalid. These check are performed before calling the
syscall functions itself to ensure that the calls are valid. Otherwise, we catch 
other errors within page_fault, and we either kill the process or exit it then. 

When these errors are raised, we always forcibly cause the thread to exit.
Thus, the thread will always reach the exit() syscall, and in return process_exit(). 
In these 2 functions, we ensure to free up all of the necessary resources the 
thread owns before freeing its memory. 


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

We utilized a semaphore (launched) in process_execute that will ensure that the current
thread waits for the new process to finish loading, irrespective of the fact
if the new process was unable to load or not. The status of this load is stored
in the semaphore's value, which we then return to the calling parent thread. This status
will notify the current parent thread whether the load was successful or not through
the PID it expected as a return value. 

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are

Waiting before C exits:
In this case, P will wait for C to finish and to exit. This is because P will be 
locked by the semaphores in process_wait() which C will release when it reaches 
process_exit(). These semaphores ensure proper synchronization between P and C, and 
allows P to regain control after C terminates.

Waiting after C exits:
We implemented process_wait() in such a way that if the child thread C doesn't exist
in the list of active threads at the time of P's call to process_wait(), then it will
return an error message (-1). Otherwise, if the child is still active, we can retrieve
its exit status, unblock it, and let it terminate easily.

The child's resources are only freed after a parent is able to retrieve the exit 
status of the child to ensure no accessing of freed memory. Otherwise, if the child
has already been freed, since the child will no longer be in the all_list, the parent
will know that the child had already exited.

No waiting before C exits:
Since the child owns the semaphore, if the parent were to exit, it would not change
or impact when C exits. This is because P will not touch C's semaphores in this case,
which will ensure that C will not be blocked by P's exit.

No waiting after C exits:
C's locks would have been released due to the fact that C has already exited, which means
that P will be able to successfully exit without any interference from the already 
terminated child.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

It was extremely easy to simply check the validity of the passed pointers first and
then raise errors if needed, and then move on to calling the built-in functions to
access memory. By handling this "error checking" in the handler case statement itself,
it resulted in cleaner code since we do not have to handle much pointer checking within
the actual syscall functions themselves. Thus, it produces code that is simple to 
understand (first check validity of arguments, then use them).

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Advantages: Each process has its own file descriptor table. This means that 
each process only accesses / keeps track of the files relevant to itself. 
This saves space, and prevents processes from improperly accessing other files. 
This approach was easiest to implement.

Disadvantages: Multiple processes can try and access the same file / have 
pointers to the same file. This is less efficient space wise (more space is 
used up because more processes track the same information). Also, despite 
our synchronizations, it requires more time (more checks) to ensure that 
only one process accesses the file at once, etc. Finally, since there’s not 
one 1 shared file table, each process has to traverse its own file table 
each time it needs to access a file. So search time for a file is always 
O(n), whereas if we had one shared table, we could access them in O(1) 
(each file is placed into the file descriptor table, at index == file descriptor).
